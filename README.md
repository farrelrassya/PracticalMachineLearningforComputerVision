# Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision
Practical Machine  Learning for  Computer Vision End-to-End Machine Learning for Images

This practical book shows you how to employ machine learning models to extract information from images. ML engineers and data scientists will learn proven ML techniques to solve a variety of image problems, including classification, object detection, autoencoders, image generation, counting, and captioning. 

This book provides a great introduction to end-to-end deep learning: dataset creation, data preprocessing, model design, model training, evaluation, deployment, and interpretability.

Google engineers Valliappa Lakshmanan, Martin Görner, and Ryan Gillard show you how to develop accurate and explainable computer vision ML models and put them into large-scale production using robust ML architecture in a flexible and maintainable way. 

You’ll learn how to design, train, evaluate, and predict with models written in TensorFlow and Keras.
